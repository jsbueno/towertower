TOWERTOWER 
==========

Framework for a Tower defense Game made using Python + Pygame

Is a base framework to evolve a tower defense game. 
It may become a full game in the future, and maybe it
stays just as one more pygame experiment.

The idea is that it can be run, and that it gets to a
playable state.
